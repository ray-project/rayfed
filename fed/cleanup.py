    This class is used to manage the related works when the fed driver exiting.
    It monitors whether the main thread is broken and it needs wait until all sending
    objects get repsonsed.

    The main logic path is:
        A. If `fed.shutdown()` is invoked in the main thread and every thing works well,
        the `stop()` will be invoked as well and the checking thread will be
        notifiled to exit gracefully.

        B. If the main thread are broken before sending the notification flag to the
        sending thread, the monitor thread will detect that and it joins until the main
        thread exited, then notifys the checking thread.
